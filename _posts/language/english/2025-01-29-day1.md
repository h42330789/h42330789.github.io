One characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit.\
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out. Grit is passion and perserverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

研究表明如果一个人具备了某种特质就能很大程度预测他将来的成功，它不是社交智力，不是好看的外表，不是身体健康，不是智商。是坚毅。\
坚毅是坚持你未来的目标，日复一日。坚毅是激情和坚持长期的目标，坚毅是有耐力。坚持是把人生当成马拉松，而不是短跑冲刺
